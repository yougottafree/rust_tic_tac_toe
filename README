Project 1: Tic Tac Toe with Rust

What the project does?
The project will use Rust to implement the Tic Tac Toe
game. When the program is run, the prompt will ask the
user if they want to play a game of tic tac toe from
start to finish or to quit the program. if the user choose
to play the game, then the game will start and the board will
be redrawn each time the player play a move, play until
one player win or a draw match. After the game, the initial
prompt will pop up again. 

How to run the project? 
If you have the compiler already, you can open the command line
to compile this code by the command:
    rustc tictactoe.rs
which will generate a byte file of tictactoe, then you can run it by:
    ./tictactoe
Then you just choose the option on the prompt to play the game

What the project illustrate about the language?
The project illustrate a lot of concepts about Rust.
Firstly, it is implemented in an object oriented fashion, 
which show that Rust is able to be an object oriented language. 
Secondly, it shows the match control flow, which is used a lot
in Rust. In addition to that, in order to make all of that work,
We have to set the mutability of the objects and variable in it, 
which is unique to Rust. The program also shows how to write loop
and get user input from command line.
